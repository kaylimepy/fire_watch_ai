# Wildfire Prediction and Visualization (Under Development)

## Project Status ðŸš§

This project is currently under development. We're working hard to gather and integrate the necessary data, build predictive models, and create insightful visualizations. Stay tuned for updates!

## Introduction

Welcome to the Wildfire Prediction and Visualization project! This project aims to predict the likelihood and potential severity of wildfires in different regions by integrating and analyzing various data sources.

## Data Requirements

### Wildfire Data

- Historical records of past wildfires.
- Key information: location (latitude and longitude), size (area burned), duration, and possible cause of the fire.
- Sources: Canadian National Fire Database (CNFDB) polygon and point data.

### Weather Data

- Weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
- Weather data significantly influences wildfire likelihood and spread.
- Sources: Environment Canada Historical Weather Data

### Vegetation Data

- Data on the type and condition of vegetation.
- Vegetation Resources Inventory (VRI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or other vegetation indices.
- Sources: GOvernment of Canada Vegetation Resource Inventory, Satellite imagery (e.g., NASA's Landsat or MODIS systems).

### Topographic Data

- Physical geography data, including elevation, slope, and aspect.
- These factors affect wildfire behavior.
- Sources: Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from Open Government Canada datasets.

### Human Activity Data

- Information about human factors like proximity to roads, urban areas, and population density.
- Influences wildfire likelihood and impact.
- Sources: Statistics Canada data, demographic databases.
